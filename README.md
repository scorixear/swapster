# Swapster
This is a process switcher build originally for Bonjwa to switch between selected processes in a timely manner.
It was build with WPF and .Net 7 and is colored in the Bonjwa Corporate Colors.

The original project from Calax can be found [here](https://github.com/CalaxDev/Switchy/tree/v0.2.0) (with slightly different approaches behind).

## Running the application
1. Downloaded the latest release file called `Swapster.exe`.
2. Install the .Net Runtime 7 (download here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
3. Start the `Swapster.exe` file.

## Recommendation
It is best recommended to put all applications in `Window` or `Borderless Fullscreen`!
